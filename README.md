 ### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 - When writing an application, it's important to keep in mind a couple of key items. A key factor in readability is to name items appropriately. For example, if many variables are named abbreviations like ```i``` or ```a```, it will be difficult to return to this section in the code and quickly understand what's going on. Updating variables to be named approriately make a world of difference. This practice also increases maintainability since it's quicker to jump back in and get acquainted to certain sections when needed. 
 - Keeing an application adaptable can be tricky. It's important to think not only of the current situation, but to think about future intentions for the application (within reason). Making sure that your application is structured in a way that it can have flexability is good, but it also provides more scenarios where maintenance could become an issue. 

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
- I find a good approach to problem solving is to take things one step at a time. When working for the final project here, I took the requirements in order and made sure that the dashboard was behaving based on each requirement. It's important to develop applications iteratively and sequential to make sure that requirements are being hit accordingly.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
- In essense, computer scientists solve problems through the use of computers and technology. We've been in the digital age for a while now, but that doesn't mean that society has completely converted to make use of the world we live in. Using project two as example, Grazioso Salvare may have been a company that did all of their animal maintenance manually through paper and other forms. By bringing this effort into the digital age and making use of a dashboard, productivity could increase based on how much the application is used. A use can now quickly filter and get information about an animal without needing to spend the time manually searching through form after form.
